# SlimeMold

Instead of having particles moving around, we should really have a transport network.

Each node gathers food and passes it to its neighbors.

The intensity of a slime mold scales with the amount of food it consumes / stores.

How to get it to grow vs thin?

I want to be able to use this principle for leaves.

Places where more food is coming from gets more impulse to grow.

But the slimemold eats a bit of the consumed food every time.

Proportional to its size?

Having thin networks means less slime eating more food, which is why its optimal.

So really thats why growth needs to happen where more food is being transported through, otherwise it needs to decay.

If I have two guys next to each other who are bigger, they can transport more between them.

If I have too many guys at one position, it overstrains the resources.

Slimemolds try to grow other slimemolds, they transport nutrients between them, absorb according to their size and transport according to their size, decay and grow according to their size.
